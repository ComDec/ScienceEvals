    We now don't need a very strong bot, this is the best one we could implement in less than a day of work.

    Brief strategy summary:
    * In the first move there is a chance of a low random bid. The weaker the hand, the higher the chance.
    * If not first move or first move and not bluffing:
        *   If we hold a high-enough combination in hand, we bid it (if there are multiple, we bid the lowest)
        *   If not, we simulate possible opponent's hands, assuming that hands with more cards matching
            their last bid are more likely. We take the action that wins for the largest (weighted) number
            of opponent's hands.
            *   NOTE: We ignore the fact that some cards declared by the opponent might be our cards, e.g.
                      if we open with 'AA' and they respond with 'AAA' then we treat this the same way
                      as if they had opened with 'AAA'. This is how we often lose against GPT-4.

    This strategy works pretty well against GPT-4, but has a pretty strong counterstrategy (bid pure-bluff high bids,
    call bluff only when your opponent raises your bluff).
