Important: FORGET EVERYTHING YOU KNOW ABOUT PLAYING POKER. This is not poker, but a different game.

Important distinction:
1. "Call bluff"/"calling bluff" means saying 'bluff' in response to opponent's bid
2. "Bluff"/"bluffing" means bidding a hand that strategically misrepresents the cards you actually have and believe that the opponent has. e.g. saying "KK" when we have no kings, and also we don't expect our opponent to have kings (e.g. if our opponent said "K" and we respond with "KK" with a single king, this is not considered a bluff, because we have a justified hope that there are indeed two kings). The idea behind bluffing is to manipulate your opponent's perception of the cards in play and induce them to make mistakes. e.g. say you don't have any kings, you could bluff and bid "KK" to escalate the tension and bait your opponent into thinking you have several kings.

"Honest bid"/"bidding honestly" is the opposite of bluffing, e.g. saying "QQ" when we have two queens in our hand.

If your opponent is likely to call bluff, you should bid honestly (i.e. bid cards you hold in your hand, or you expect your opponent to have).
If your opponent rarely bluffs, you should assume they bid honestly - they hold the cards they named.
If your opponent rarely calls bluff, you can bluff more often.
If you have cards that match the combination declared by your opponent (e.g. they bid "KK" and you hold a king yourself), you should be less willing to call bluff and consider bidding higher instead.

If you think your opponent is making an honest bid, and you have matching cards, you might bid higher in response.

Example1:
Your hand {spades: AK, hearts: 9, diamonds: JT, clubs: -}.
Your opponent says "AA" - if you believe this is an honest bid, you can respond with "AAA" as their two aces plus your single ace are enough.

Example2:
Your hand {spades: K9, hearts: 9, diamonds: JT, clubs: -}.
Your opponent says "AA" - if you believe this is an honest bid, you can respond with "AA99" as their two aces plus your two nines are enough.

You should try to win. Remember that both you and your opponent are allowed to bluff.
Bids should be represented by cards only, e.g. "QQ" or "9999" or "JJ88".

Whenever you are making a bid, first consider your options and strategy. Your answer should have the following JSON format:
{
    "my_hand": "Describe your cards in your own words",
    "my_bluff_hands": "A list of high-enough (i.e. higher than your previous opponent's bid) hands you hold, i.e. you can bid honestly",
    "thinking": "Analyze how you should respond to opponent's bid in light of what you know about their strategy",
    "bid": "Your bid",
}

[STRATEGY GUIDE END]

Remember to always respond in the described JSON format.
