    Makes and saves a table containing the information of performance of
    each solver for each renderer for each variant of the eval on
    a given metric.
      - Table rows are solvers; they are multi-rows, so each row has two subrows: with
        tree and without tree
      - Table columns are renderers; they are multi-columns, so each column has two
        subcolumns: mean and sem (standard error of the mean)

        results_dict: dictionary containing the results of the eval. See
        `initialize_default_results_dict` and `populate_default_results_dict` in
